   <p>ROB MAHONEY: The Milwaukee Bucks. There are fascinating things happening at every level of the organization. At the top of the roster, you have one of the most awesome combinations of superstar talents we’ve seen in quite some time. Giannis Antetokounmpo finally gets to work opposite an explosive lead guard, and Damian Lillard finally gets to play off of the kind of do-it-all big he never had in Portland. Together, they should have the sort of output that melts defenses. Yet just about everything else with the Bucks feels a touch uncertain. A lot will be asked of Khris Middleton (at 32 years old, coming off a string of injuries) and Brook Lopez (35), without much margin for error. This season will be an open tryout for a rotation that already feels thin, which turns players like Jae Crowder, Malik Beasley, and MarJon Beauchamp into figures of sudden leaguewide importance. That’s enough to make any contender nervous. It’s all happening under the watch of first-time head coach Adrian Griffin, who lost his top assistant before Milwaukee even made it out of camp. We’ll be talking about the Bucks all season as a contender, an experiment, a trade option, a buyout destination, and so much more.</3>

    <p>JUSTIN VERRIER: The Minnesota Timberwolves. Anyone who spends time around Anthony Edwards quickly becomes convinced of his superstar potential. But can the Wolves clear a runway for his ascension with two centers clogging the lane? And if they do move Karl-Anthony Towns and his gargantuan contract, is Ant ready for all that comes with being the clear-cut face of a franchise after a mixed run as Team USA’s go-to guy in the World Cup? There’s a lot to like about Minnesota but maybe even more to figure out.</9>

    <p>SEERAT SOHI: The all-in-on-offense Phoenix Suns, who traded the disgruntled Deandre Ayton and what little resistance they could provide on defense for the flat-footed, rebound-munching pick-and-roll bomber that is Jusuf Nurkic. This, of course, comes after they traded two 3-and-D dynamos for Kevin Durant and shipped Chris Paul off in exchange for Bradley Beal.

    The Suns’ blisteringly efficient new Big Three all had true shooting percentages over 59 percent last season and will make about $50 million apiece next season, when the punitive implications of going over the second apron of the luxury tax will kick in. This is an experiment in unorganized but explosive excess—from the firepower down to the cap sheet—and the biggest existential threat to the adage that defense wins championships that this league has ever seen.</12>

      <p>LOGAN MURDOCK: The Boston Celtics. Last season, Boston’s offense transformed under first-year coach Joe Mazzulla. But the team couldn’t get out of the shadow of Ime Udoka’s preseason departure and was left to adjust to its new head coach on the fly.
        Over the summer, the Celtics filled Mazzulla’s staff with veteran assistants like Sam Cassell, Charles Lee, and Phil Pressey. They traded for Kristaps Porzingis and, most recently, Jrue Holiday and re-signed Jaylen Brown to the richest contract in NBA history. The moves make the Celtics better on paper, but the banners in the Garden are getting dusty, and it’s time to add to the trophy case. Each of the past two seasons has ended in disappointment, including a seven-game collapse against the Heat last May, which brought their team’s toughness into question and put their new coach on the hot seat. This year, I’m excited to see the two Jays™️ take on the challenge of sky-high expectations and use everything they’ve learned over the years to finally reach the NBA mountaintop.

 <div class="row">
  <p class="questions">2. Which player are you most excited to watch in 2023-24?</p>
<div class="col-md-3">  
<div class="scroll">
 <p>Murdock: Victor Wembanyama, the 7-foot-4 bag of bones, has already taken the league by storm. I look forward to seeing him nutmeg 6-foot guards in otherwise listless January games. The past year has been filled with testimonials to the 19-year-old’s brilliance and the promise that he’ll carry the NBA into the future. But the most intriguing part of his game is how much it’s been influenced by the stars who came before him. Wemby can shoot like Durant, he can run the floor like Giannis, and he has the ceiling of LeBron. </p>
  <p>But more importantly, I can’t wait to see how he develops under the tutelage of Gregg Popovich, the godfather of the league, who is simultaneously responsible for guiding the French sensation and shielding him from the biggest league hype machine in decades. Wemby’s preseason play has yielded fruitful results. In his latest outing, a 19-point, five-block performance against the Warriors, Wembanyama made plays that left observers in awe. It was the latest showcase for a center trying to bring the Spurs out of the bottom of the standings. And if the preseason is a sign of things to come, Godspeed to the rest of the league.</p>
  </3>
  </div>
  <div class="scroll"> 
    <p>VERRIER: Victor Wembanyama. Any other answer would be a lie. Spurs preseason games were appointment viewing, and the no. 1 pick still managed to exceed expectations—nutmegging defenders in transition, dunking over normal-sized centers with little effort, showing a competitive streak when tested by peers, hitting stepbacks from midrange like a stretched-out Kobe, blocking every damn shot imaginable. Victor’s a true one-of-one, the kind of player who makes you laugh nervously multiple times a game because you can’t believe what he just did.</9>

  <p>MAHONEY: Victor Wembanyama. This is a thrilling time all around the NBA, but let’s be real: There’s only one dude who’s plucking opponents’ 3-point attempts out of the air and nutmegging them for good measure. Maybe it’s a little basic to be wowed by the things Victor has been doing lately, but what other reaction are we supposed to have to a player whose dimensions bend the laws of time and space? What am I supposed to do with the fact that Wembanyama can take a step out from the paint and block a shot all the way out on the wing? I haven’t the faintest idea, but we’ve seen enough already to know that Wembanyama is at least a few degrees removed from anything we’ve seen before. And that “we” isn’t just you and me—it’s the whole NBA world. It’s all of us as a basketball culture. As a species. Opposing teams are strapping extended pads to the arms of their assistant coaches just to get their players—the best and most athletic on the planet—used to some shit that is beyond the scope of normal basketball consideration. So, yeah, the unfathomable, unprecedented source of all that strikes me as someone I might like to see as often as possible.

<div class="scroll"> 
  <p>SOHI: The dimension-shifting elastic man who evokes comparisons to Michael Jordan’s half-court dunk in Space Jam and threatens to reshape the very geometry of the court. The early returns on the Victor Wembanyama experience have gone something like this: a first-quarter flurry of blocks and deflections followed by hesitation and fear in the eyes and actions of his opponents. Deterrence motivated by destruction.
    Just the other night, Klay Thompson rushed his 3s for most of the game after a pump fake that allowed Wembanyama to not leap, but shuffle on balance from the paint to the perimeter to block his shot.
    Wembanyama’s combination of height, flexibility, agility, and wingspan is already forcing veteran NBA players to recalibrate the terms of the court they have long been accustomed to. The Wembanyama era is here, and Thomas Bryant’s face says it all.

  <p class="questions">3. What is the most intriguing story line of 2023-24?</p>
<div class="col-md-3">  
<div class="scroll">
 <p>Verrier: It’s the fate of James Harden—but less because of how Harden, fresh off his latest playoff disappointment, impacts the title race and more because of how a trade affects the future of Joel Embiid. Swapping Harden straight up for another star seems unlikely, at best … but it’s also hard to figure out how Daryl Morey could flip the pile of stuff he would get for Harden into a star down the road. Cap space doesn’t seem all that helpful, given the paltry upcoming class, and any follow-up trade might force the Sixers to fork over prized up-and-comer Tyrese Maxey. Maybe Maxey will make a major leap and Philly will get its no. 2 the old-fashioned way? But the path to an appropriate running mate for the reigning MVP is fuzzy. And if Trader Daryl can’t pull it off, it might be Embiid’s turn to ask out, leading to the kind of tectonic-plate-shifting deal we haven’t seen since the summer of 2019.

</div>

  <div class="col-md-3">  
    <div class="scroll"> 
  <p>Murdock: Joel Embiid’s future in Philadelphia. Lost in James Harden’s trade request is how the Beard’s eventual departure will affect Philly’s MVP center. In his nine-year tenure with the Sixers, Embiid has endured the Process, the departure of Ben Simmons, and the arrival of Harden—and has made zero conference finals appearances. The frustration boiled over this summer, when Embiid said he’d like to win a title, “whether it’s in Philly or anywhere else.”</p>
  <p>Harden will soon be out of the picture, and no matter who takes his place, the road to a title will be paved by Embiid’s play in the postseason. In recent years, he simply hasn’t played to the caliber of his peers, like Giannis and Jokic, who just won his first ring. Last postseason, after winning MVP, Embiid put together a subpar performance against the Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals, shooting just 38 percent from the field over the final two games. Embiid can point to the Sixers’ lack of continuity, coaching changes, and the Harden reversal as reasons for wanting out. But before he looks for greener pastures, he should look in the mirror.

  <div class="scroll"> 
  <p>MAHONEY: Is any team in the West ready to actually challenge Denver? Because last we checked, the answer was an emphatic no. That seems like it could be a bit of an issue come springtime, when the most serious challengers in the conference will have to reckon with the Nuggets’ buzz-saw offense all over again. Most of the teams in that contending class spent the summer improving in their own ways. The Suns supercharged their attack. The Lakers got deeper. The Warriors cleaned up their act. All of that is well and good, but none of those clubs have materially improved the way they match up with the best player in the world, the two-man action that drives everything the Nuggets do, or even the supporting cast that complements it all so perfectly. I suppose you could certainly try to just outscore Nikola Jokic and all the great looks he helps create. I’m just not sure why you’d feel especially confident about that prospect when Denver’s finely tuned playoff offense made dominance look so easy.

  <div class="col-md-3">  
    <div class="scroll"> 
    <p>SOHI: Giannis Antetokounmpo is locked, loaded, and extended, and the situation with James Harden in Philly remains at a stalemate, so the attention of a league built on capitalizing on the unhappiness of superstars turns to the Lone Star State, where one has to wonder: Will the wheels fall off in Dallas? </p>
      <p>Summer-body Luka came to an unceremonious end when he all but accused FIBA referees of fixing matches and, in the preseason, re-aggravated the calf injury that impeded him in last season’s playoffs.</p>
    <p>The Mavericks had a better offseason than anyone expected them to, but don’t let that cagey draft-night trade for Richaun Holmes distract you from the headline: They still gave Kyrie Irving more job security than he’s had in years, and they’re relying on Grant Williams and two rookies to bolster what was a bottom-six defense last season.

   <p class="questions">4. Who do you want to see get traded in 2023-24, and to where?</p>
 <div class="col-md-3">  
 <div class="scroll">
  <p>SOHI: In the interest of putting championship-level shot deterrence to its best use, I want Rob Williams III moved off the rebuilding Blazers and shipped to Memphis to replace Steven Adams, who is out for this season with a knee injury. Despite Steve Kerr’s best efforts with Team USA this summer, Jaren Jackson Jr. isn’t really a 5. He’s a little too jumpy, erratic, and foul-prone as a rim protector with no backup, and he doesn’t rebound well enough for the position. The Time Lord, accustomed to playing alongside another perimeter-oriented big in Al Horford, could stabilize Jackson’s role—as well as Memphis’s season.</p> 
  
  <p>Adams’s and Williams’s contracts cancel each other out, and the Grizzlies still have a few of the juicy draft assets Portland would want back in a potential trade. Williams, who turned 26 last week, is in the same coming-of-age phase as Memphis’s core, while Adams could play an off-court mentorship role without putting Portland at risk of winning too many games or displacing Ayton.

   <p>VERRIER: Donovan Mitchell to Miami. We’re probably a year too early for Spida Watch, but it’s hard to imagine the Cavaliers will solve their issues—namely, Evan Mobley’s still-developing offensive game and how he fits with a traditional center like Jarrett Allen—this season, before Mitchell enters a contract year in 2024-25. So why not get ahead of the inevitable and try to recoup the premium assets they’ll need to build a future around Mobley and Darius Garland? The Heat might not have the best package (just ask Joe Cronin), but they’re the most exhilarating fit: Mitchell would supercharge an offense that proved to be too reliant on Jimmy Butler magic as last postseason dragged on and would vault Miami back into the elite tier of the title race.

   <p>MAHONEY: Pascal Siakam to the Pacers. Or the Hornets. Or the Hawks. Or really to any team where he would have a clearer future. Siakam is a tremendous player who, if nothing else, deserves to understand where and how he fits into his team’s plans. The picture in Toronto is a little too murky for that—particularly with the same old positional glut in the middle of the Raptors’ lineup and since Siakam is rolling into a contract year without the certainty of an extension. Maybe it’s just time to let a good thing go. Siakam is flexible enough to help all sorts of teams, but his game would really sing in the open floor of a faster-paced offense. All three of the teams above play with that kind of tempo, have an evident positional need for a forward just like Siakam, and could pair him with a high-level playmaker to make his life easier. Let’s make it happen; free Pascal—all involved could be better off for it.

Last season, the Lakers kicked the tires on a deal for Turner before deciding to revamp the roster elsewhere, but the 6-foot-11 center’s shooting and defense could still be a boon to prospective contenders. Let’s send him to Dallas.

The Nuggets stand above; I don’t see much reason to expect that a healthy Denver team wouldn’t have a similarly successful run through the conference, especially when so many of the principal characters involved might only get better. Things are a bit tougher to parse out East, with the Bucks, Celtics, and ever-persistent Heat, but the foundation of Giannis and Dame just feels too strong to doubt. There’s a lot for Milwaukee to sort out between now and the Finals, but there’s a lot of time, too—enough for a full arc of growth and change and compromise.

All due respect to Denver, who blew away the competition en route to last season’s title, but I still have my doubts about the Nuggets’ ability to hold up against a five-out offense. Recent playoff history has been written by teams that can spread out a defense and attack the weak link, and the Celtics, now armed with one of the best two-way lineups in recent history, have the shooting to unroot Nikola Jokic from the paint and the scorers to attack the likes of Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. in isolation.</p>
      
      <p>Boston certainly isn’t without its own flaws (Jaylen Brown’s left hand, Kristaps Porzingis’s health, and Al Horford’s age-induced decline are at the top of the list), but it has the lineup versatility to match up with any team—yes, including the reigning champs.

  MAHONEY: Lakers-Bucks. I’d love to see the greatest player of his generation play against the player who wants to carry that baton into the back half of the decade. Fortunately, these two teams have the rosters to make a run. The Bucks are the class of the Eastern Conference after landing Damian Lillard. Meanwhile, the Lakers, led by Bron and AD, have one of the deepest rosters in the NBA, and Davis has taken the matchup against the Greek Freak personally in recent years. Last December, Davis dropped 44 points and 10 rebounds in a win over the Bucks.</p>
 <p> A series between these two teams would give LeBron one more shot at a title, setting the stage for a legendary potential farewell for the King or a ’91 Jordan–like coming of age for Giannis. At this point, I’m taking the latter. Bucks in six.
